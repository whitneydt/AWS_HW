In this note book I have preporocessed the data in order to reduce dimensions in order to Utilize PCA and clusetering using K-Means
I have also graphed an Elbow Curve to find the best value for k.
Once I deduced the best value for k, the Kmeans algorithm is used to predict the k clusters for the cryptocurrencies data.
You can find the results of this cluser in the dataframe name "clustered_df"
You can also visualize the data utilizing the plots that were createdn using hvplot.
